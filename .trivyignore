# Trivy Ignore File

# Strategy: Ignore vulnerabilities in packages only present in build stages

# These are devDependencies that never reach production containers

# Ignore Node.js devDependency packages (testing, linting, build tools)

# Pattern: Only scan production dependencies, not build-time tools
